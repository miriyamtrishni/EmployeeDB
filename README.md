## 📌 About the Project
This is a simple **Employee Database Management System** built using **.NET** with SQL database integration. It is a learning project aimed at understanding database operations, CRUD functionalities, and SQL queries.

The application allows users to **add employees, search employees, and manage their details** efficiently. It retrieves employee records from two tables and displays relevant information such as:
- **Branch Name**
- **Employee Number** (auto-generated)
- **Employee Name**
- **Age** (calculated from Date of Birth)
- **Active/Inactive Status**
- **Actions** (Update / Delete Employee Data)

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Add New Employees** with Name, Branch, and Date of Birth (Employee Number assigned automatically).  
✅ **Search Employees** by Branch Name, Status, or Age (Age Over filter).  
✅ **View Employees List** with details fetched from the database using SQL queries.  
✅ **Update Employee Details** directly from the interface.  
✅ **Delete Employee Records** when no longer needed.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
